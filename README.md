# Safety Device(Safee) - Emergency Contact App

## Overview
**Safety Device** is an Android application that allows users to quickly send emergency SMS messages with their current location and contact emergency services. The app enables users to:
- Add, edit, and delete emergency contacts.
- Send an SOS message with a location link to a pre-set contact.
- Directly call a saved emergency contact.

This project is designed to enhance user safety by providing quick access to critical contacts and enabling location sharing in emergencies.

## Features
- **SOS Button:** Sends an SMS with the user's current GPS location to a predefined emergency number.
- **Emergency Dial:** Instantly dials the user's saved emergency contact number.
- **Contact Management:** Add, edit, and delete emergency contacts stored locally on the device.

## Technology Stack
- **Java:** Core language used for Android development.
- **Android SDK:** For user interface components and native features.
- **Google Gson:** For JSON serialization and deserialization of the contact list.
- **Location Services & SMS Manager:** For obtaining GPS coordinates and sending SMS.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio installed on your computer.
- A physical Android device for testing (recommended) since SMS and GPS features may not work accurately on emulators.

```

### Setup
1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the app on a connected Android device.

## Code Structure
